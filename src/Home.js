      <p>
        I have a degree in art history from Oberlin College and Studio Art
        Centers International in Florence, Italy. My professional background is
        in legal research, environmental conservation, and food service. I
        became interested in computer programming because I have always been
        fascinated with puzzles and problem solving. I studied Software
        Engineering at Flatiron School, where I worked on a variety of projects
        both in pairs and individually.
